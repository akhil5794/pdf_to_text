 iiWhat could I possibly say at the end of a year like 2020? Only 
ﬁThank you.ﬂ
Thank you to the clinicians, informaticists, and healthcare 
executives who have worked tirelessly to set the world back on 

course through the upheaval of COVID-19. 
Many will never know the countless extra hours you™ve worked 
or hear the stories of your courageous care in the face of 

overwhelming odds. But from the bottom of our hearts, thank 

you! May we never have another year like 2020, but if we do, I™m 

encouraged to know you are in our corner.
Even amid a global pandemic, thousands of dedicated 
healthcare leaders took the time to jump on a call with KLAS. 

In the face of massive changes in care delivery, you gave KLAS 

crucial feedback on the tools and services you relied on to 

weather the storm.
At KLAS, our mission is to improve healthcare by bringing to light the experiences of healthcare IT users and 

decision makers. These collective experiences are shared in KLAS ratings, reviews, and reports. Providers 

and vendors alike use these insights to improve. When you have better information, you can make better 

decisions. And better decisions lead to improved healthcare across the world.
Despite the challenges of 2020, we collected over 22,000 evaluations from healthcare IT leaders and 
decision makers this year. Their perspectives are the backbone of this annual Best in KLAS report. I believe 

it represents the most comprehensive report of its kind in the industry.
While comprehensive, the Best in KLAS report means little if the report data isn™t trusted, impartial, and 
fair. Here in Utah, we™re blessed to have one of the geological wonders of the world, the Delicate Arch. 

The Delicate Arch earns its moniker by looking as if at any moment, it might tip one way or the other and 

collapse into rubble. But it has never wavered. Rain or shine, for thousands of years, the Delicate Arch has 

stood firm. 
When we founded KLAS, we adopted the Delicate Arch as our company icon. Our commitment is that 
KLASŠlike the Delicate ArchŠdoesn™t lean one way or the other. We represent the voice of provider 

organizations without bias. We work to bridge the gap between health systems and their vendor partners. 
I™m honored to be part of a company and an industry that can withstand the pressures of change and 
continue to stand strong despite those challenges. As I look forward to 2021, I am excited to work together 

with you to tackle the challenges that matter most.

KLAS makes thousands of proactive calls each year to 
collect the research necessary for this report. In every 

instance, the KLAS methodology includes screening 

for bias to˝ensure as clean and random a sample as 

possible. To learn more about KLAS™ research process 

and methodology, please visit

.Ranked Solutions
Ranking and Overall Performance Score: 
For each 

market segment in this report, the so˙ware and services 

solutions eligible to compete for Best in KLAS are ranked 

by their overall performance score (100-point scale). 
Ł For so˜ware products
, these scores are  
based on customer responses to 16 numeric 

ratings questions and 4 yes/no questions, all 

weighted equally.
Ł Client feedback on 
services firms
 is comprised 
of 9 numeric ratings questions and 3 yes/no 

questions, also weighted equally.
Understanding This Report
Overall scores are calculated by averaging all evaluations 

collected for a given solution over the last 13 months (19 

months for some select services). In general, only one 

solution from any given vendor may be eligible for Best 

in KLAS ranking within any given market segment. This 

solution will always be the vendor™s most recent version. 

In instances where a vendor has multiple solutions of 

similar age (through acquisition, etc.), only the most 

comprehensive solution (i.e., the one the vendor would 

lead with in the segment) is eligible.
Trend:
 Where available, trend data is included to indicate 
the percent by which a score has changed from the 

previous year™s Best in KLAS report. ﬁN/Aﬂ in the trend 

column indicates that a solution was not included in the 

previous Best in KLAS report or was not a ranked solution 

in that report.
Customer Experience Pillars: 
To enable readers to 
more quickly understand high-level diˆerences in vendor 

performance, the questions from the KLAS evaluation 

are organized into customer experience pillarsŠsix for 

so˙ware products and five for servicesŠwith vendors 

receiving a letter grade in each pillar (see grading scale on 

following page).

Solutions in the categories below are not eligible for Best 
in KLAS ranking, though overall performance scores and 

customer experience pillar grades are still displayed.
Ł Limited Data (*): 
Solutions whose sample sizes 
do not meet KLAS™ required thresholds for Best 

in KLAS ranking but do meet lower ﬁlimited  

dataﬂ thresholds. See ﬁSample Sizesﬂ below for 

more details.
Ł Component [C]: Solutions that include most 
but not all components of a complete system/

service or serve only a subset of the market.
Ł Limited Market Share [MS]: 
Solutions that do 
not have a suˆicient number of live customers to 

qualify for a Best in KLAS ranking.
Ł Not Primary [NP]
: Solutions that may still be 
purchased but are not a vendor™s lead solution 

in a market segment. In some cases, these 

solutions may not be actively sold in the listed 

market segment.
Ł Regional [R]:
 Solutions for which the majority 
of data comes from organizations in a small, 

specific geographical area.
Sample Sizes
KLAS requires that the sample size for any given solution 

reach certain thresholds before data can be reported.
Total evaluations vs. unique organizations:
 The sample sizes displayed throughout this report (e.g., n=16) 

represent the total number of 
individual respondents
 who 
submitted an evaluation (ﬁtotal evaluationsﬂ) for a given 

solution. It should be noted that a vendor™s sample size 

may vary from question to question as some respondents 

choose not to answer particular questions. To allow for 

the representation of diˆering perspectives within any one 

customer organization, samples may include individuals 

from the same organization. However, in order for a 

solution to be eligible for Best in KLAS ranking, feedback 

must have been received from a certain number of 

unique organizations
 (see ﬁData thresholdsﬂ below). This 

is done to prevent any one organization™s feedback from 

disproportionately impacting a solution™s score.
Data thresholds: 
KLAS™ data thresholds vary depending 
on the solution type.Ł So˜ware products:
 To be eligible for Best in 
KLAS ranking, so˙ware products must have a 

sample size of at least 15 unique organizations. 

Sample sizes of 6Œ14 unique organizations are 

designated as limited data. If the sample size is 

below 6, ratings are not shown.
Ł Services:
 To be eligible for Best in KLAS ranking, 
services must have a sample size of at least 6 

unique organizations. Sample sizes of 3Œ5 unique 

organizations are designated as limited data. If the 

sample size is below 3, ratings are not shown.
Ł Payer products:
 To be eligible for Best in KLAS 
ranking, payer products must have a sample size 

of at least 10 unique organizations. Sample sizes 

of 5Œ9 unique organizations are designated as 

limited data. If the sample size is below 5, ratings 

are not shown.

 Thank you to our departing members:
ﬁWhat a treat it has been having Rich serve on the KLAS Advisory Board. His input from a 
CFO perspective has brought insights to the board and to KLAS that we could not acquire in 

other ways. If one of our ideas did not seem to hit the mark, there was no hesitancy for Rich 

to share the concern. Not that he enjoyed shooting down our ideas, but because he cares 

about our mission and wanted us to spend our energy and resources where they would best 

meet our mission and benefit provider organizations. We have been so fortunate to have his 

leadership and wisdom guiding us these past several years. His influence will be missed–

but he will definitely be on our radar for continued involvement with our research.ﬂ

Most Improved 
So˜ware Product
Customer satisfaction with IBM Watson Health Merge PACS 
has increased 20% since last year among organizations with 

an annual image volume of over 300,000 studies. While there 

is still room for additional improvement overall, customers 

highlight improvements to the support, describing the staˆ 

as more knowledgeable than in the past. Customers also feel 

that IBM Watson Health has responded well to COVID-19, 

providing strong remote upgrades and training along with 

more frequent communication, which has benefitted the 

overall relationship. Additionally, some customers report 

improved stability and reliability with decreased downtime. 

One director shared,
 ﬁThe support has actually improved, and 

we have seen some good changes. IBM has a good team right 

now and a better understanding of the system. IBM has made 

some internal changes that have been helpful in regard to the 

ticketing process. It feels like there is more communication and 

more transparency. We would still like to have more insight, but 

I think IBM is working toward that. IBM is focusing on solving 

our problems rather than just closing our tickets.ﬂ
Notable Performances
Epic was again named the top Overall So˙ware 

Suite, narrowly beating out MEDITECH Expanse 

to win the award for the eleventh straight year. 

Epic was also named the top Overall Physician 

Practice Vendor, coming in several points ahead 

of athenahealth and NextGen Healthcare, who 

tied for second. Additionally, Epic won nine other 

Best in KLAS awards in various market segments. 
Most Improved 
Physician Practice Product
Midsize physician practices (11Œ75 physicians) that 
use athenahealth athenaPractice EMR have noticed 

improvements in the quality of athenahealth™s support 

and customer relationships. They say the vendor has 

gotten better at setting proper expectations for product 

enhancements and has become more proactive in 

their customer reach-out. Additionally, customers feel 

athenahealth™s executive involvement has improved 

markedly, and they feel more connected to the vendor 

than in the past. A nurse practitioner stated,
 ﬁIn the last 
couple of years, I have seen a big di˜erence in athenahealth™s 

engagement with the customer. The vendor is more receptive. 

Before, if we needed something, we had to reach out. Now 

athenahealth reaches out to us to see how we are doing. The 

communication is there. . . . That has been great because 

we can sometimes avoid problems and misunderstandings 

with the vendor. I have seen changes. I don™t know whether 

athenahealth is talking to KLAS, but they are talking to 

somebody and listening to somebody. I think that is great.ﬂ
Galen Healthcare 
was named 

the top Overall IT Services Firm, 

excelling in HIT Implementation 

Leadership (Small: <8 

Resources), HIT Staˆing, and 

Technical Services.
In 2020, The Chartis Group 
displaced 

Accenture as the top Overall Healthcare 

Management Consulting Firm, achieving 

extremely high customer satisfaction for 

their Financial Improvement Consulting 

engagements and also performing 

solidly in Strategy, Growth, and 

Consolidation Consulting.

ﬁI think about the research you guys have 
done, maybe once every 7 to 10 days. It seems 

like that™s how o˚en we have a question on 

di˜erent products, so 
we continue to find 

the services you provide very valuable. We 

really appreciate the research.ﬂ 
 ŠCIO, Large Acute Care Facility
Can We Make 
a Connection?
Healthcare™s a long way from perfect. And while 
we may have had to adjust our plans in 2020, 

we™re optimistic about getting back together 

safely, and soon.
Real change can't happen without collaboration. 
That means getting the right people in the 

room together.

Hindsight Is 20/20
That™s why you have KLAS
When it comes to making a decision on the next product or service your healthcare organization needs, 
research takes time. It takes time to uncover the likely candidates, understand their strengths and weaknesses, 

and most importantly, determine whether their sales team is pitching substance or smoke.
In 2020, KLAS gathered 
22,056 evaluations from healthcare professionals. The vast majority of these 
evaluations came from on-the-phone discussions, resulting in deeper and more insightful feedback.
KLAS has published scores and commentary for more than 
800 healthcare IT products and servicesŠgiving 
you the gi˙ of hindsight. If you™re making a so˙ware or services decision in healthcare, come learn from those 
who have walked a similar path.

Why Measure 
EHR Satisfaction?
Measuring your clinicians with the Arch 
Collaborative allows you to understand how 

to improve your EHR™s usability and eˆiciency. 

Organizations using Collaborative-led 

improvements have seen:
Improved E˚iciency
Reduced Burnout
Higher Retention
ƒClinicians who strongly agree that their 
ongoing training is eˆective are over 
2x more 

likely to report immediate chart-closure rates 

above 90%.   Clinicians who strongly disagree that their 
ongoing training experience is eˆective are 
3.5x 
more likely to state that they are completely 

burned out (i.e., at the point where they may 

need to seek help).  
Clinicians who strongly disagree that their 
ongoing training experience was eˆective 

are over 
4x more likely to state that they are 

planning to leave their organization in the next 

two years.
ƒThe AMA estimates that losing a physician costs an 
organization two to three times the physician™s annual salary.

Improved e˜iciency, reduced burnout, and 
increased retention all have real impact on 

not only the dollars spent in healthcare, 

but also on the experience of those cared 

for and those providing that care.

SomeMinimalWhile KLAS seeks to gather feedback from healthcare provider organizations on their IAM suite as a whole, the reality today is that most are 
at the start or in the middle of building and executing a long-term strategy. With this in mind, the basic framework below outlines common 

IAM capabilities. These select capabilities were the focus of KLAS™ recent research and validation eˆorts and are not intended to cover all 

aspects of IAM. Other components of an IAM strategyŠe.g., privileged access management, access control, and password managementŠ

were not a focus of this report but may be included in future research.

The KLAS 
Difference
ﬁWe need a company like KLAS that can take a look at things, try to aggregate information, and 
help people to make better-informed decisions.
 I think KLAS is essentially the only organization 
out there that really does those things.
 I think that work is very useful; if I didn™t think so, I 

wouldn™t be talking to KLAS.ﬂ

Healthcare Professionals
In 2020, we gathered 22,056 

evaluations from our conversations 

with healthcare professionals from 

across the globe.
22,056Healthcare 

Organizations Globally

KLAS reports represent the 

candid feedback of clinicians 

and leadership from over 4,500 

organizations across the world.

KLAS maintains scores, 

commentary, and reports on 

over 800 products and services 

in the healthcare marketplace.
800What Sets Our Research Apart?
Not Your Average Survey

KLAS o˙en follows up our online evaluations with a call from one of our researchers. This helps prevent falsified 

data and leads to plenty of deep conversations that create the commentary we publish online.
Thousands of Voices
KLAS reports represent the real voices of professionals from provider organizations across the globe. Their 

participation gives us not only the scores you see in this Best in KLAS report, but all the scores and commentary 

we publish online throughout the year.
