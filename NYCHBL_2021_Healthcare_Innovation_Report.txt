3But 2020 was also ˜lled with resiliency, compassion, 
and collaboration. Many companies in our healthcare 
ecosystem took actionŠdoubling down, pivoting, 
acceleratingŠtackling the immediate challenges 
facing healthcare as well as their employees. 
To better re˚ect these efforts, we™ve changed the 
name of the annual publication from Healthcare 

Venture Capital Report to Healthcare Innovation 
Report. Because it™s not just about the funding, 
 it™s also about what the entrepreneurs do with that 
fundingŠhow they™re driving change, improving 
access, upgrading processes, and impacting lives. 
This year, more than ever, we needed action and our 

New York ﬁsquadﬂ stepped up and delivered. 
As you™ll see throughout the report, the explosion 
 of digital health in New York has been astounding. 
 I remember attending the ˜rst-ever Health 2.0 
conference in 2007 when digital health meant 
online support groups, wisdom of the crowd, 
 and blogging. Fourteen years later, technology is 
embedded in everything we do. Much like digital 
 ad agencies morphed into simply agencies, digital 
health will become, simply, health. Technology 

powers everythingŠit™s what we do with the tech that 

matters. It™s exhilarating to see the range of ideas 
and people excited about changing healthcare for 
the better. 
Thank you to our 50+ contributors for their incredible 
insights. Congratulations to the 100 innovators 

selected for the 2021 NYC Digital Health 100.  
A special shout out to P˜zer for producing a vaccine 
in record time and making us New York proud. 
By the time we publish next year™s report, I hope we 
will have seen each other again in person at one of 
NYCHBL™s legendary events. 
Last year our lives as New Yorkers changed 
completely. As the city became the 

pandemic™s epicenter, of˜ces shut down, 

schools closed, and healthcare workers 

became our heroes as they valiantly helped 

patients battle COVID-19. In the spring and 

summer, we confronted the issue of 

systemic racism, which coincided with data 

showing that the pandemic had impacted 

Black and Brown communities at far 

greater numbers than others.

61 The funding never stopped.
When the pandemic hit, many of us thought it would have a negative impact on 
fundingŠinstead there was a 40% bump in funding over 2019Šincreasing from 

$2.B to $3.6B! Digital health was the biggest recipient garnering 69% of the 

dollars. The rounds got substantially larger: in 2019, only one company (Oscar) 

raised over $100M; in 2020, Oscar was joined by four more: Cityblock Health, Ro, 
Cedar and Medly. Another interesting ˜nding: seven of the 
Top 25 companies
 raised at least two rounds during the year. 
2 Virtual care took center stage. 
Investors poured $1.3B (about 35% of total funding) into virtual care, a re˚ection 
of its starring role during the pandemic. Telehealth has been around for decades, 

but in 2020, millions of patients experienced a video visit for the ˜rst time and 

tens of thousands of once-resistant providers became converts. While it took a 

pandemic to prod both groups to test it out, regulatory changes to payments 
 and licensing closed the deal. Learn more about what™s ahead on the 
regulatory 
front
 on 
page 29
. 3 Mental health came out of the shadows. 
Mental health has been called the shadow pandemic of 2020 because the levels 
of depression, anxiety and stress skyrocketed during COVID. As a result, new 

approaches to mental health treatment have blossomed and become more widely 

adopted. New York is at the heart of this movement and is quickly becoming the 

center of digital mental health. Investors put $200M (about 5% of total funding) 
into this vertical and we expect this area to expand. Learn more about the 
mental 
health start-ups
 driving this growth on 
page 26
.4 Health Equity grabbed our attention. 
New York™s Black and Brown communities were disproportionately affected by 

coronavirus, highlighting disparities in care. A number of New York companies 
 
are trying to address the imbalance, most notably Cityblock which took in $214M 

in new funding. Discover more about the issues related to equity and potential 

solutions necessary to close the gaps on 
page 24
.5 Therapeutics & Diagnostics hit the front page.
PCR testing is the new normal, and mRNA technology has become a frequent 

topic of discussion (at least among this crowd). New York life science companies 

of all
 sizes played an active role in addressing COVID-19, most notably P˜zer, but 
smaller start-ups got in on the action, too. Take a closer look at a few of the 

players on

We™ve been tracking New York 
health and life sciences funding

WE ENDED 2020 WITH A MAJORITY 
RECAPITALIZATION BY THOMA BRAVO
 and the simultaneous acquisition of HealthX. 
With the new capital, we™ll be able to add many 

product enhancements and continue to build a 

world-class service organization. The HealthX 
acquisition allows us to bring Zipari™s CX 
Platform and market-leading products to an 

additional 170 customers. 
It™s been an 
incredible ride from a start-up six years ago to 

a valuation of over $500 million today...
and I 
feel like we™re still just getting started on our 

mission to help health plans be more 

consumer-centric.

FUNDING IN 2020: 
TOP 25
125 EARLY-STAGE 
 Investors 
to Know
Visionaries see potential and take risksŠthey™re the lifeblood 
of start-ups. Even during a dif˜cult year, early-stage 

investors have continued to ˜nd, fund and incubate some of 

healthcare™s most exciting companies. Meet ˜ve investors 

making an impact in New York™s venture community.
Why early?
I think it™s important to be comfortable with what 
early stage really meansŠmore questions than 
answers, more vision than product, more ideas 

than dataŠand to me it™s the most personally 

gratifying stage because investors and founders 
are able to build a really unique relationship 
(ideally a trusted friendship) by being there from 

the beginning. We love meeting founders early, 
even when it™s just people and an idea. We™ve 
been very consistent in our strategy, which is 

laser-focused on the early stage. 
Why healthcare?
Initially we were less focused as a fund on 

healthcare because it seemed specialized. Our 

deep friendships and relationships led us to our 

˜rst healthcare investments: Flatiron Health and 
PillPack. Now about 25% of the fund™s focus is 

healthcare, and much more as a percentage of 
mind share. As a generalist investor, I love the 

deeply mission oriented nature of healthcare 

companies and we™re excited to continue invest in 

companies that help unlock better healthcare 

access for all.
Advice for founders pitching you?
Make it a conversation and articulate the pain point 

clearly. A concept that we like is ﬁfounder/market 

˜t.ﬂ Why are you uniquely positioned to tackle this 

problem? And why did you choose it? How do you 

see the market differently than others? Why are you 
going to spend the next 10 years focused on this? 
What™s your unfair advantage? Those are some of 

the ﬁhowﬂ and ﬁwhyﬂ questions that we ˜nd most 

compelling in a pitch.

 Garner Health, K Health, Level, 
Maven Clinic, Oscar, Ribbon 
Health, Ro, Tomorrow Health
Where should healthcare 
 entrepreneurs focus?
There are two big challenges for healthcare start-ups to tackle. 
First: How do you keep a healthy population from becoming 

sick? Second: How do you manage chronic care conditions more 

ef˜ciently, knowing they generate 80-90% of total healthcare 

costs? There™s plenty of room for innovation in both areas. 
Prevention is growingŠAI will enable better early detection and 
diagnosis. Technology can make a major impact in the chronic 

population with telehealth, pharmacy, remote patient monitoring 

and ef˜ciency of payments. 
Give us an example from your portfolio.
Managing medications for your entire life is complex and involves 

addressing multiple conditions. Medly offers a fundamentally 

better pharmacy experience by using data more effectively and 

enabling more personalized plans. Plus they deliver, eliminating 

the need to visit a brick-and-mortar store. We think Medly is 
going to be one of the leaders in managing chronic conditions 
and specialty medicine.
What impact did COVID have on 
 the space?
Digital penetration and telehealth have clearly accelerated across 

the board. That whole world has been pulled forward very rapidly, 

with an acceleration in adoption and TAM that has exploded. In 

the long run, though, regulation will also be a big factor in how 

these trends play out. What happens with reimbursements 
across the board going forward is very important, especially for 
telehealth. Cross-state licensing is another unknown. Some 

restrictions were loosened due to COVID, but we don™t know if 

those will come back.

13What should we know about AlleyCorp?
AlleyCorp founds and funds early-stage companies in 
New York. Founded by long-time entrepreneur, Kevin Ryan, 

AlleyCorp is unique in structureŠwe do not have LPs, 
 
we often launch companies as co-founders, we gravitate 

toward investing in ˜rst-time founders, and we focus on 
NYC. Some of the later stage New York companies 
AlleyCorp has originated include MongoDB, Gilt, 

BusinessInsider, Zola, and Nomad Health, and we 
 continue to co-found new companies each year.
What investments did you make 
 in 2020? 
Although AlleyCorp is industry-agnostic, we placed a 

much greater emphasis on healthcare in 2020 than in 

years past. Within healthcare, we made 10 early-stage 

investments in 2020 in digital health broadly, with a 

speci˜c focus around value-based care delivery, digital 
therapeutics, and data infrastructure. These investments 
ranged from $1M-$2M, the majority were in NYC, and a 

few were incubations which we started from scratch. 
Why the laser focus on NYC? 
A core part of AlleyCorp™s mission since its founding 
 over a decade ago has been to grow entrepreneurship 
 in NYC. The diversity of talent, breadth of industry 

representation, and strength of creative thinking here 
 is unrivaled. We™ve developed a robust ecosystem to 
support ˜rst-time founders and early-stage company 
growth in NYC and continue to be very excited about the 

future of innovation here.

Therapeutics, Diana Health, Nomad 
Health, Pearl Health, Reside Health, 
Tempest, and Voya Health
What is your fund™s philosophy?
We believe in female founders and have created 
a portfolio of 100% female founders. Today 

women account for less than 2% of venture 

˜nancing, but we know there will be many 

billion-dollar companies built by women. 
And why healthcare?
We™re generalists but have a thematic approach: 

B2B, healthcare, ˜ntech, and seed stage. We 

were early in seeing that women™s health should 

not be described as a niche area. We invested in 

Maven Clinic and became aware of the critical 
need for speci˜c solutions in women™s health. 
After Maven Clinic, we were early investors in 

other category-de˜ning health companies such 

as Shine (wellness), Real (mental health) and Oula 

(maternal health).
Tell us more about Oula.
Oula is a modern birthing clinic in Brooklyn 
 
using a collaborative approach. Eighty percent 
 
of births in the US are low-risk and don™t need 
 
to be in a hospital. We are also paying attention 

to the growing disparities in Black and Latino 
communities. When you look at outcomes for 
Black women, the maternal mortality rate is high. 

Oula is looking at ways to use technologies to 

connect culturally savvy clinicians with 

underserved populations.

Investors 
to Know
What differentiates Tusk?
We sit at the nexus of technology, politics, and regulation. From our point of view, many of healthcare™s problems 
stem from misaligned incentives resulting from antiquated regulations and reimbursement rates. So we focus on 

investing in companies that are operating in highly regulated markets or creating new business models where no

An example of a company breaking the mold?
Ro, because it™s more than just a DTC product companyŠit™s a vertically integrated new type of healthcare system. 

Though they started with conditions like E.D. (erectile dysfunction) and hair loss, they are quickly moving into 

managing chronic conditions like diabetes and thyroid issues. Ro is using telehealth and other technologies to 

manage patients more ef˜ciently within a safer and more convenient environment.
What about health disparities?
Technology™s largest bene˜t to the market often is transparency. Zip code by zip code you can see what COVID™s 

infection rates have been. It™s apparent that this has been a tale of two pandemicsŠthe parts of the population 

that need our help the most are the least likely to get it. Those are the next problems that need to be solved, 

and we™re ready to invest in meaningful solutions.

Why We 
 New York
New York endured a great deal of loss during 2020. 

This included the death of Milton Glaser, the iconic 

designer, who created the instantly recognizable I Love 

New York logo. Here are just a few reasons why our 

community will continue to build, support, and invest in 
New York for years to come.
NYC IS THE LARGEST HEALTHCARE 
MARKET
 in the US and has been the most active 
metro area for digital health investment in 2020. 

We have the investment dollars, infrastructure and 

diversity of talent to build the leading digital health 
ecosystem. We™re excited about all the activity right 
in our backyard.

NEW YORK CONTINUES TO BE AN 

EXCEPTIONAL PLACE
 for innovationŠwith 
the opening of signi˜cant amounts of new

funds dedicated to the life sciences, we expect 
the entrepreneurial wave to continue in a 
signi˜cant fashion.

 have is getting on the radar of 
larger companies. We launched 
PulsePoint

 to make it easier for health data 
start-ups to build, launch, and scale. Our 
goal is to help these innovators with 
resources like platform access, commercial

environment to support these companies in 

achieving the better health outcomes that

Building 
Community
When we founded NYCHBL in 2009, our goal was 
 to build a healthcare ecosystem in New York. A 

decade Œ and pandemic Œ later, that ecosystem has 

become a community that supports, partners and 

works together to drive success for its members. 
Collaboration is truly King–and Queen.
A COMMUNITY OF FEMALE FOUNDERS
 is emerging in New York as well as a growing 
number of start-ups focusing on women™s 

health. It™s inspiring to see incumbent Kate 

Ryder of Maven Clinic so willing to connect with 
other female founders from Oula and Helania, 
who are also building women™s health tech 

start-ups.

Powering 
Through COVID
Resiliency is the ability to not just survive, but to 
actually thrive in the face of adversity. During the 

COVID crisis, these leaders embodied that 

characteristic in the ways they responded and 

innovated, pivoting and expanding to meet the needs 
of their customers Š and their own employees.
WE LAUNCHED IN APRIL, 
at the peak of 
the ˜rst wave of COVID-19. We had to pivot 
 our care delivery immediately, using a range of 

technologies such as mobile pre-visit registration 

and text messaging platforms to digitally 
 screen our patients. We saw a dramatic spike 
 in psychosocial needs such food insecurity, 

˜nancial hardship, depression, and anxiety. We 

worked closely with our community partners to 

ensure that patients were connected to services 

and supports.
SUZETTE BROWN, MD, MPH
Founder & COO, 
 Strong Children Wellness
OUR CORE BUSINESS IS
 genomics-as-a-
service, but we know PCR testing well. When 

COVID struck, we responded quickly. We developed 

a clinical study to test an at-home saliva test for 

COVID-19, rapidly recruited patients and received 
FDA approval (Emergency Use Authorization) in 
June. It was a sprint but a great decision that 

opened up new ways to work with employers and 

individuals. The test was even featured on Dr. Oz.
ALEXANDER BISIGNANO
Co-Founder & CEO, Phosphorus
OUR BUSINESS WAS BUILT FOR THIS 

MOMENT
Šwe just thought this moment was 
going to happen 5 or 10 years from now. Millions 

of people who had never experienced telemedicine 

were introduced to it for the ˜rst time, creating 
extreme demand for online healthcare visits. We 
worked to make sure we had the infrastructure in 

place to scale while still delivering an exceptional, 

personalized experience. 
STEVEN GUTENTAG 
Co-Founder & CEO, Thirty Madison
WE PRIORITIZED HEALTH AND SAFETY 

FOR OUR TEAM
Šnot just physical health, but 
mental health too. To stay connected, we kicked 

off a ton of events including morning meditation, 

daily planking, and trivia nights. The pandemic 
created a bit of a silver lining in that everybody 
was home and navigating this dif˜cult moment 

together, even when apart. People showed up 

bringing their whole selves to work, not just their 

work selves. And that™s how it should be. 
MICHAEL CUNNION 
CEO, Remedy Health Media
18I HAD ONLY BEEN CEO FOR TWO WEEKS 
when the pandemic forced us to work from home in 

early March. My ˜rst priority was the health and 

safety of my employees, but as their new leader I 

also had to earn their trust. I sent every employee a 
handwritten card letting them know I was thinking 
about them and encouraging them to take care of 

their own mental health during this unprecedented 

time. Almost one year later, we saw employee 

engagement increase and virtually no attrition.

TO HELP OUR STAFF STAY BOTH

FULL-BODY MRIS HAVE EXISTED 
FOR A WHILE, 
but the cost ranged 
 
from $10,000 to $15,000. With Ezra, 
 
we brought it down to $2,000 by using 

software and building AI to make the scans 
and interpretation faster. We™ve created a 
way to screen for cancer that™s fast and

more affordable. I dream of a future with a 

$500 full-body scan.

pieces are needed. 
FARIS GHAWI 
CEO, Vytalize Health
23Can Telehealth be Saved from 
Systemic Racism?
Alongside COVID-19, America has been slowly acknowledging the public health crisis of racial 
injustice. Even prior to COVID, structural racism had a devastating impact on healthcare, education, 

employment, housing, and infrastructure in Black and Brown communities. Health outcomes have 

lagged commensurately and dramatically. This is the house that COVID-19 entered. A house poorly 

equipped, staffed and supported for routine healthcare. Telehealth doesn™t ˜x the larger problem. 

Layered on top of our existing inadequate system, telehealth exacerbates the problem. Only 

investment to combat the underlying system will allow telehealth to reach its true potential of 

enhanced access to care.  
Communities of color and low-income households are frequently confronted by a digital divide with 
inadequate access to computers, high-bandwidth internet, and remote monitoring devices. While 64% 

of households with an annual income of $100,000 or greater have access to a smartphone, desktop or 

laptop computer, broadband internet, and a tablet, only 18% of households making less than $30,000 

have the same access.
The solution must then be multipronged. First, there needs to be awareness, understanding and 
acceptance that systemic racism has massively contributed to the chronic underinvestment in the 

healthcare system of our communities of color. Second, national and local plans must be developed, 

tested and scaled to comprehensively address de˜ciencies and gaps. Finally, investment is necessary to 

address fundamental gaps in the digital divide and infrastructure to support our community and safety 

net health system. 
Telehealth leaders cannot sit idly by waiting for broad infrastructure changes to come to fruition. As 
an industry, we must develop programs and services which af˜rmatively combat structural racism and 

ensure equitable access.
In hope,

Health 
Equity
 The pandemic highlighted the vast health disparities and 

inequities that exist in the country, particularly for Black 

and Brown communities. The move to virtual care only 

exacerbated the problem, because not all people have 
equal access to broadband and mobile technologies. 

Healthcare and business leaders in New York are 

identifying and developing new ways to close 
 these gaps.
Below is an edited portion of an 
Open Letter
 written by Gil Addo, CEO of RubiconMD in September 2020. He™s also 
a member of 
HT4M
 (HealthTech4Medicaid) focused on bringing critical new technology to Medicaid enrollees.
24AS THE PANDEMIC HIT, MOUNT SINAI™S 
CARE MANAGEMENT TEAMS BEGAN 

RECEIVING CALLS 
from the community alerting 

them to behavioral health issues such as increased 

suicidality and anxiety. With in-person visits canceled 
due to COVID, services were being provided virtually. 
It soon became clear that many of the families lacked 

broadband access, which prevented them from 

getting care. 
We realized that education had solved that problem 
earlier in the spring by distributing Wi-Fi-enabled 

devices, which gave us the idea to piggyback on their 

infrastructure. We partnered with the Dream School, a 

public charter school in East Harlem that serves about 

1,200 children K-12. We heard from Dream that asthma 

and behavioral health education were big priorities, so we 
hosted online forums with primary care doctors and 
specialists to not only provide education but allow 

opportunity for families to ask questions directly to the 

clinicians. We are working on additional projects with the 

Dream School to empower families to use technology for 

both medical and social care needs so that they gain 

con˜dence in managing their care and the challenges 

they face every day. 
ROBERT FIELDS, MD

THOUGH WE NEEDED NO 
REMINDER, THIS PANDEMIC 

CONTINUES
 to show us all that the 
people who will always suffer the most are 

communities of color, folks with disabilities, 
those who are LGBTQIA+, and people with 
limited economic means. There are 110 

million people in the US living in lower-

income communities that desperately 
 need better-integrated care. They need 
 a revolution. And they need it now.

DURING COVID, SOME HEALTH PLANS 
TEMPORARILY BEGAN TO PAY
 for telehealth 

visits on par with in-person care, but they only 

reimbursed video visits, not care via telephone. Many 

patients we see do not have access to video-enabled 
devices and can™t use Zoom or Google Hangouts. The 
notion of only reimbursing video speaks to the 

underlying socioeconomic issues of access and equity.

25Mental 
Health 
2020 was the year conversations about depression, 
anxiety and addiction went mainstream. People across 

every demographic experienced isolation, loneliness 

and depression, including children and teens. With 
 one of the highest concentrations of therapists per 
capita in the country, New York has long been a center 
of mental health. Now it™s rapidly becoming the 
epicenter of digital mental health, too. Clinicians and 

entrepreneurs are introducing new models that address 

age old problems of access, siloed care and lack of 

insurance reimbursement.

TRADITION IN MENTAL HEALTH

NYC in 1909. It™s no surprise that as health 

technology has grown in NYC, an emphasis on 
mental health start-ups has become evident.

TIA HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT 

MENTAL HEALTH IS ﬁCOREﬂ TO

challenges like sexual trauma that all too many

CAROLYN WITTE

PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

29Q What are you expecting this year on 
telemedicine legal and regulatory change? 
A In the federal sphere, it is all about reimbursement. 
Although we have been operating during the public 
health emergency under very helpful waivers that 

signi˜cantly expanded telemedicine coverage to Medicare 

bene˜ciaries, post-emergency federal legislation will be 
necessary to remove decades-old statutory limitations 
 that narrowed Medicare telehealth to patients at certain 
facilities in rural areas. Given recent policy activity and 

Congressional hearings, stakeholders believe some 

permanent legislative change on Medicare coverage is 

possible in 2021. As to states (those with the primary 
 legal authority over health provider regulation and thus 

telemedicine), the annual legislative cycle kicked-off with a 

running start on various telemedicine related topics Œ from 

telehealth modality (e.g., video, audio-only, async) changes 
proposed by some states to a focus on Medicaid coverage 
of telehealth and cross-state licensure in others. So, 

buckle-up, we are in for lots of telehealth policy in 2021! 
Q Are you seeing expanded applications for 
the use of telemedicine modalities beyond 
clinical care? 
AYes, indeed! In recent years, industry stakeholders 
have increasingly pursued a range of ﬁdecentralizedﬂ, 
ﬁremoteﬂ or ﬁvirtualﬂ clinical trial protocols, which involve 

the leveraging of wearables and other remote data 

gathering and communication technologies, together with 
the deployment of home health personnel to perform 
certain at home trial procedures. 
These developments implicate both FDA and state 

regulation for US state trials, and there has been broad 

acknowledgment that further regulatory clarity is needed 

going forward. In that regard, the onset of COVID in 

2020 did provide impetus for FDA to issue guidance on 
the conduct of trials remotely from traditional ﬁbrick and 
mortarﬂ sites. FDA™s guidance provided numerous 

recommendations for sponsors, investigators and IRBs 

to consider for adapting ongoing trials or when 

preparing for the launch of a new trial, during the 

COVID-19 public health emergency, with subject safety 

and data integrity being paramount considerations. 

Among many other issues, FDA addresses the potential 

use of telemedicine modalities for remote trial visits. 

Other international regulatory authorities, including the 
EMA and MHRA, also have issued guidance for the 
conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although certain COVID-19 related guidance may expire 
at the end of the public health emergency, some may be 

extended in one form or another. There is increasing 

enthusiasm for the ˚exibility and ef˜ciencies associated 

with at home clinical trial procedures, where appropriate. 

For example, elderly or physically challenged subjects 

and their caregivers may appreciate the option to 

participate in clinical trials from home and 

communicating with the study doctor through 
videoconference. Telemedicine can also move forward 
other important objectives, including increasing the 

diversity of clinical trial participants to achieve greater 

equity in health outcomes.
HEALTHCARE REGULATORY 
What™s in Store 
For 2021?
In 2020, swift regulatory changes helped make widespread adoption of telehealth and virtual 
care possible. We sat down with Alexis Gilroy and Maureen Bennett, two legal experts at Jones 
Day, to discuss the future regulatory landscape for these technologies in both care delivery and 
clinical trials. For ongoing regulatory insights and tracking, subscribe to

Therapeutics 
& Diagnostics
 New York once again proved its position as leader in 
therapeutics when P˜zer became the ˜rst company to 

emerge with a vaccine for COVID-19. But smaller NYC 

biotechs made equally important contributions. Some 

leveraged their experience and pivoted to provide 
immediate solutions such as face masks and at-home 
testing. Others stayed focused on their core businesses 
and found ways to adapt to the new remote reality. 

Prevail Therapeutics ended the year with a great exit: 

$1B sale to Lilly. Several companies went public, some 

through traditional IPO like Schrodinger, Zentalis and 

Delcath Systems, others through a SPAC merger like 
Nuvation Bio and 180 Life Sciences.
BIOTECH COMPANIES LIKE OURS

there were many ways to keep our employees

WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT CONSTITUTIONAL 

GENETICS
ŠWHAT MAKES UP YOUR DNA
Š  the genes you inherited from your parents. In most 

specialties, physicians typically do not order a genetic 
 test until you™re very sick due to lack of insurance 
coverage for preventive screening. While many conditions 
are avoidable, they™re generally not discovered until there™s 

been an event. Our goal is to change the care paradigm 

so that we screen everyone before there™s a problem.

 OF THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES
 has 
been simply remarkable. It™s brought both a 
reputational boost, and a boost in overall

3132Why have SPACs become 
 so popular?
We™ve always been big believers in 
SPACs because you can use them 

as a tool to bring companies public 

earlier. SPACs allow you to marry 

due diligence without a crossover 

round before the IPO, leading to 

less dilution for private companies. 

In early 2020, I predicted there 

would be six biotech SPACs, and 
people thought I was crazy. Now as 
of year-end, there are 34 

healthcare-focused SPACs seeking 

targets, 19 of those are biotech 

speci˜c, four have announced 

transactions, and six have closed.   
And healthcare 
 SPACs?
Historically, SPACs were not 

focused on healthcare, aside from 

a handful of healthcare services. 

An easy-to-understand business is 
usually the best opportunity for 
SPACsŠtraditionally that™s meant 
consumer goods and industrials. 

Now there™s an appetite for growth 

stories, so biotech SPACs have 

taken off. In particular, the Health 

Sciences Acquisition Corp/
Immunovant (IMVT) deal woke 
people upŠthey started to realize 

the potential in biotech. Now, lots 

of SPACs are looking at digital 

health and healthcare IT as well, 

and I expect that to continue 
 going forward.
What™s one thing we should 

know about Chardan?
Chardan has established a 

reputation for ﬁ˜nancing the frontier 

of healthcareﬂ by focusing on 

industry disruption and innovation. 
Seventy percent of our focus is on 
disruptive biotech sectors like 

genetic medicines, cell therapy, and 

microbiome medicines. We also see 

potential in devices, diagnostics, 

digital health, and other burgeoning 

areasŠwe™re always looking for 

growth companies with technology 

or an asset that have the potential 
to generate 5-10x investment 
returns, by creating and sharing in 

real value for society. 
What are the advantages of 

taking a company public via 
 a SPAC?
SPACs are ideally suited for 

high-growth companies where it 
 is important to be able to provide 

growth forecasts which is not 

permitted in regular IPOs. The 

SPAC process permits a target 

company to ˜rm up ˜nancing 

before a public announcement. 

Whereas in an IPO, on account of 

having to ˜le terms publicly before 
book building, targets are either 
over-conservative in valuing 

themselves or forced to publicly 

accept a diminution in terms or, 

worse, shelve the IPO after 

conducting a public process. 
 One can put together incentive 

structures linked with future growth 

which is not possible in an IPO. 
Healthcare 
SPACs
 Special purchase acquisition companies (SPACs) exploded in popularity across all industries in 2020, and 

healthcare was no exception. SPACs are an alternative to a traditional IPO in which a blank-check company (i.e. 

SPAC) merges with a private business to form a publicly-traded entity. New York investors were part of this trend: 

investment banks, hedge funds, private equity and venture capital ˜rms all created SPACs during the year.
A signi˜cant transaction that helped catalyze the popularity of healthcare SPACs occurred in 2019, when New 
York-based Immunovant merged with Health Sciences Acquisition Corp. Since its IPO, Immunovant has been one of 

the top performers on the NASDAQ, delivering 4x returns to investors. 
There are both advantages and drawbacks of SPACs relative to traditional IPOs. We spoke with three investors to 
learn more about when and how SPACs work for emerging healthcare companies.

33Which areas of healthcare are 
most attractive for SPACs?
Sectors where one is (a) experiencing 

substantial disruptive growth i.e. the 

investment thesis is future-oriented 

thus more time is needed for 

diligence (b) where there is 

appreciable public/private arbitrage 

(c) there are large private companies 

with limited IPO windowsŠin the 

past, device and diagnostic 
companies have ˜t the bill. 
What is your experience 
 with SPACs?
We closed a merger with DermTech 
(DMTK), a molecular cancer 

diagnostics company in 2019 which 

is trading at 11x the transaction 
 
price as of early February. We 

recently announced a $1.1 billion 

merger with Humacyte, a universally 

implantable human tissue 

regenerative medicine company 
which has attracted signi˜cant 
support from marquee investors.
Why did you create Lux 

Health Tech Acquisition Corp? 
We felt the SPAC was a really good 

way to disrupt healthcare and 

technology. Our thesis is that a 
funding gap exists across 
healthcare technology which 

impacts devices, digital health, lab 

equipment, diagnostics and 

telehealth. Biotech is less of a 

focus because many other SPACs 

are in that sector. In health tech, 

many start-ups become tuck-in 

acquisitions to the incumbent 
companies, leaving a lot of 
opportunity on the table. These 
start-ups develop their ˜rst 

application but don™t have the 

capital to propel the business 

further. That™s where we come in.  
Why a SPAC vs. 
 traditional IPO? 
For the right company, SPACs 
provide critical bene˜ts. Fundraising 
is treated more similar to a private 

raise than public company offering. 

The investors are all having 

conversations about the company™s 

direction, which creates more 

alignment. We think the SPAC is a 

wonderful opportunity to provide 

curated go-public experiences.
What kind of companies do 

you target? 
We really like companies with 

platform technologies. The ability 

to scale those existing platforms 

and develop or acquire content 
providers is compelling. We also 
like when a company™s core 

technology can be extended into 

other areas.
ﬁOur thesis is that a 
funding gap exists 
across healthcare 
technology which 
impacts devices, digital 
health, lab equipment, 
diagnostics and 
telehealth.ﬂ

certain verticals (like MSK for example) will 
require platforms to be built for speci˜c

Where Will the 
Money 
Flow Next?
It™s been said healthcare transformed more in ˜ve months 
during COVID than it has in the past 10 years. Now that the 

wheels are turning, and money is ˚owing, where will we see 

new investment? What trends are on the horizon? These 

leaders offer a look ahead.
ONE OF THE MEGA-TRENDS WE™VE 

SEEN OVER THE PAST 5-7 YEARS
 is the 

rise of direct-to-consumer healthcare. High-

deductible plans are increasing, so people are 

paying more out of pocket. As a result, they are 
taking more control over their health, looking at 
what they™re spending and why. COVID only 

accelerated this trend. 
RICK HEITZMANN 
Partner, FirstMark Capital
IN 2021 WE EXPECT TO SEE THE 

PRACTICE OF MEDICINE EVOLVE 
more to 

precision medicine, enabled by the widespread 

availability of molecular diagnostics. Key drivers 

include increased access to and declining cost of 
gene sequencing; new drug discoveries, and 
real-world data on biomarkers that help match 

patients to the best therapies.

(like menopause!) and chronic conditions.

 Frontlines
In December, NYCHBL hosted 
Healthcare Rocks!
, a virtual 
concert honoring the heroes of 2020. It was a magical 
night that included candid conversations with clinicians who 

were on the frontlines battling COVID-19. We™ve captured 

their re˚ections below and added several more. Their 
strength, compassion and hope will inspire you.
WHAT STOOD OUT THE MOST WAS 
THE PANDEMIC
 of racism that came out of 
this pandemic. Disproportionately, Black and 

Brown people have died from the pandemic, 

not because of the virus itself, more because of 
systematic racism. I work in a very poor 
communityŠa level 1 trauma center in Brooklyn 

Šand there are many institutional disparities. 

Until we have these painful conversations that 

racism is a public health issue, we™re not going 

to move past this level of uncertainty.

WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT IN MARCH,
 Mount Sinai was one of the ˜rst hospitals to jump 
into action, and many medical students joined in to 

help. We organized one of the largest medical school 

responses in the country in close partnership with 
our hospital system, helping with everything from 
coordinating PPE donations, triaging telehealth visits 

to staf˜ng pharmacy sites and boosting our 

COVID-19 testing capabilities.

SERVING AS A FRONTLINE HCW 
during 
the ˜rst wave of the pandemic was a surreal 

experience. I held patients™ hands while 

increasing their oxygen, helped them FaceTime 

with their families when visitors weren™t allowed 
in, and provided rehab to patients as they took 
their ˜rst steps after being on a ventilator for 

weeks. We were driven by pure adrenaline to save 

lives during the NYC surge.

AFTER 35 YEARS IN PRIVATE 
PRACTICE, 
I arrived as a volunteer at 
Bellevue in April 2020. Being resolute in my 

desire to do everything for each patient, I 

mustered my energy to move the COVID-19 
mountain. However, the virus was solid, alien, 
unforgiving, and so deadly. For each patient, I 

felt immeasurable sadness that I couldn™t do 

more. I spent time with families hoping to be 

of comfort. It reminded me that empathy, 

humility, and kindness are vital in the care of 

each patient, especially when we do not have 
 a cure.

IN MARCH, I WAS DEPLOYED IMMEDIATELY
 to 
Elmhurst, a city hospital, that operates on a shoestring budget 

and is always at maximum capacity. Having hundreds of COVID 

patients per day ˚ooding into the ER completely overwhelmed 

their system. Elmhurst became the epicenter of the epicenter–
While we saw a lot of suffering, we also witnessed some 
incredible human resilience. Everybody in the hospital pulled 

together with heroic effort, from the attendings in their sixties 

and seventies, to med students and nurses, right down to the 

cafeteria workers and janitors who didn™t miss a beat.

ONE OF THE FLOORS OF THE 

CHILDREN™S HOSPITAL 
was 

converted for adults, to take care of 

coronavirus patients. Many of us hadn™t 

taken care of adult patients in close to 
a decade, so we had to relearn adult 
medicine. It was certainly a trying time 

with more patient death than many of 

us have seen in our careers. But there 

was also so much humanity that came 

into it. You saved patients, comforted 

patients, and said goodbye to patients 

when you needed to. We had the 
 
best of outcomes and the worst of 

outcomes, and you had to deal with 
that as a physician.

taking care of people and saving lives. We saw the Navajo 

come together to help protect elders and those most 
vulnerable to COVID-19, as well as bring food, water, and 
supplies to those in need. The courage and resiliency of the 

workers on the frontlines when the pandemic hit were a 

beacon of hope for what was to come.
